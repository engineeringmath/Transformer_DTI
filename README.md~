# Transformer-DTI

# Highly accurate and robust diffusion tensor estimation with only 6 measurements 

This is a deep neural networks  model for diffusion tensor estimation.

The model is based on the Trnasformer neural networks.

The work was completed at IMAGINE laboratory of Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School  (https://imagine.med.harvard.edu/).

## Trained model

A trained docker model can used by running the following two lines. DATA_DIR refers to your local data directory.

docker pull davoodk/brain_extractiotransformer_dti
docker run   --mount src=/DATA_DIR/,target=/src/test_images/,type=bind  brain_extractiontransformer_dti:1.0

For the code to run successfully, you need to place the folloiwng files in DATA_DIR:

### Diffusion-weighted MR image.

This should be a nifti image and shuld end in "dwi.nii.gz".

### Brian mask

This should be a nifti image and should include "brainmask" in the filename.

### b-values and b-vectors files

These should be test files and include "bval" and "bvec" in the filename. They should be readable by numpy's loadtxt command.

The above formats have been chosen following the developing Human Connectome Project naming. You could use this dataset to test the code.


## Results:

On dHCP data, as well as other datasets, our method with only 6 measurements can estimate the diffusion tensor with an accuracy that matches the accuracy of standard DTI reconstruction methods with 88 measurements.
